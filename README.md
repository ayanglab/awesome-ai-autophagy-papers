##  Introduction

Deep learning-based generative models have significantly transformed AI and machine learning. These models generate realistic data for images, text, speech, and music, with innovations like **DALL-E 2**, **Imagen**, **Suno**, and **Sora**, alongside advanced language models like **ChatGPT**. These technologies enable seamless integration of visual, textual, and auditory data.

Training these models requires extensive, high-quality datasets, often sourced from web scraping. For instance, **CommonCrawl** is a widely used petabyte-scale open-source web crawling database. However, as web scraping increases, so does the risk of incorporating synthetic data generated by other models, leading to potential performance degradation. This phenomenon, termed **"autophagy,"** occurs when models are trained on AI-generated content, potentially causing models to consume themselves.

While synthetic data can initially seem beneficial, over-reliance can lead to negative impacts such as performance degradation and diversity drop. There is a significant gap in the literature on the comprehensive impact of synthetic data use across different modalities.

##  What technical strategies can mitigate the negative consequences of AI autophagy?

### 🍒 "Cherry-picking": Filter out low quality synthetic data during training
**Personal Note**: Although some papers demonstrate the efficacy of cherry-picking in fine-tuning large language models, imaging data still suffers from a [quality-variety tradeoff](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01850).

### 💧 Watermarking: Mark synthetic data (and filter them out during training)
#### 📷 Image Watermarking
Watermarking synthetic images is a promising approach, already finding real-world applications in AI-driven image generation.

In 2023, Google DeepMind, in collaboration with Google Cloud, launched [SynthID](https://deepmind.google/technologies/synthid/), a beta tool for watermarking and identifying AI-generated images. SynthID subtly embeds a digital watermark within an image's pixels, making it invisible to the human eye but detectable for verification purposes. It was initially released to a select group of Vertex AI customers using Imagen, which is a text-to-image model producing photorealistic images. But the technical details of SynthID is not revealed. Similarly, StableDiffusion includes a feature in its [reference sampling script](https://github.com/CompVis/stable-diffusion#reference-sampling-script) which incorporates an invisible watermarking of the outputs using a Python Package invisible-watermark, to help viewers identify the images as AI-generated. The default setting in StableDiffusion inference used a combination of DCT and DWT algorithm. 

However, using watermarking for security or verification assumes uniform adoption of the same watermarking scheme across all image generators, which, while technically feasible, could be costive and prone to attacks. Moreover, an effective watermark detector (decoder) requires knowledge of the technical specifics of the watermarking technology. However, this is often not feasible as many companies are reluctant to disclose their proprietary technical details, posing a challenge to the widespread implementation and effectiveness of such watermarking systems.

#### 📖 Text Watermarking

Similarly, as image watermarking techniques, watermarking may not effectively prevent the misuse of NLP generative models unless it is uniformly applied across all powerful LLMs. In real-world settings, where users typically have access only to black-box language models, it is impractical to manipulate the model’s vocabulary distribution or intervene in the text generation process. This limitation reduces the effectiveness of during LLM watermarking strategies. However, post LLM watermarking methods [fall short compared to integrated approaches in preserving the quality of generated texts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15992), and they are [more susceptible to being circumvented by paraphrase attacks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11156).

### 🔍 Detection: Identify synthetic data (and filter them out during training)
#### 📷 Synthetic Image Detection
Non-watermarking-based detection methods ensure there is no compromise in image quality. However, despite the wide proposal of methods claiming to be generalizable, it remains uncertain whether these detectors can be effectively applied to previously unseen synthetic images without thorough experimentation.

#### 📖 Synthetic Text Detection
As the most widely adopted approach, non-watermark based detection techniques are prevalent across commercial platforms. A key advantage of these techniques over watermarking is their non-intrusive nature; they do not compromise text quality. Thus, we see a lot of detect algorithms based on non-watermarking techniques, such as [GPTZero](https://gptzero.me/),  [Originality.ai](https://originality.ai/), [Turnitin’s AI detection tools](https://www.turnitin.com/solutions/topics/ai-writing/). 

However, a significant challenge for non-watermark based LLM detectors lies in their generalizability, or their capacity to recognize AI-generated texts from new domains or models. Despite many algorithms boasting detection accuracies above 90% in their experimental result section, the boundary between human and AI-generated texts is becoming increasingly blurred as AI technology advances. For example, in the evaluations on a “challenge set” of English texts,[ OpenAI’s text classifier only identifies 26% of generated text](https://openai.com/index/new-ai-classifier-for-indicating-ai-written-text/). 

In addition, the [explainability](https://www.vanderbilt.edu/brightspace/2023/08/16/guidance-on-ai-detection-and-why-were-disabling-turnitins-ai-detector/) and [potential bias](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02819) of these detectors raise additional concerns, for which there are currently no definitive solutions.

An vivid example is that the word "and" can be followed by many possible words, with "the" being one of the most common successors. In contrast, the phrase "ladies and" typically has fewer plausible continuations, with "gentlemen" being the most likely. Therefore, encountering the phrase "ladies and the" within a text serves as a strong signal of artificial manipulation or forgery. | 2008     |

## What regulatory strategies can address these negative consequences?
- **[Interim Measures for the Management of Generative Artificial Intelligence Services](https://www.cac.gov.cn/2023-07/13/c_1690898327029107.html):**
  - **Marking Generated Content**: Providers must mark generated content, such as pictures and videos, to prevent public confusion.
  - **Real-Name Verification**: A proposed but omitted measure involved real-name verification for content creators, requiring users to submit identification documents to use the generator, thereby improving content traceability.
